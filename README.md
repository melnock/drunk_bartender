# drunk_bartender
CLI Project

This is Baloon Bar. Our bartender is a really creative bartender.  He loooves all aspects of his job, especially sharing a drink with (all) his customers.  He can make a great drink, but you may get a surprise in your drink! If he gets too drunk, you might need to order some water for yourself to get anything coherent from him!

Ask him for a drink with a specific kind of liquor and see what you get! He has a soft spot for jokes.  Ask him for one! He might even provide some good advice if you ask at the right time!

Good luck and happy cocktail-ing!
